# TimberCloud

**TimberCloud** is the all-in-one platform built to transform how woodworkers and manufacturers run their business.

We help cabinet shops, millwork houses, door shops, furniture makers, and other production shops sell online, automate quotes, manage orders, track inventory, and streamline production—with tools built specifically for how they actually work (board-foot, square-foot, custom parts, LTL freight, and all the edge cases in between).

This GitHub organization is home to the code, docs, and integrations that power TimberCloud.

## 🔩 What We’re Building

Core pillars of the TimberCloud platform:

- **Embedded Storefronts**
  - Embed a modern, branded online store into an existing site.
  - Support for complex, configurable products (dimensions, species, finishes, profiles, hardware, etc.).
  - Customer-specific catalogs, pricing, and rules.

- **Smart Product & Pricing Engine**
  - Custom logic for board-foot, square-foot, linear-foot, unit-based, and assembly-based pricing.
  - Margin controls, minimums, waste factors, upcharges, and project-level overrides.
  - Automatic part breakdowns for production.

- **Orders, Quotes & Workflows**
  - Quote → order → production flows built for real shops.
  - Cut lists, job packets, status tracking, and internal notes in one place.

- **Inventory & Purchasing** (Modular)
  - Track sheets, lumber, hardware, and components across locations.
  - Deduct stock from orders, generate purchase orders, and maintain an audit trail.

- **Shipping & Freight Integrations**
  - Live parcel rates + label generation.
  - LTL & freight workflows for heavy, bulky, made-to-order products.
  - Customer-owned carrier accounts where possible.

- **Developer-Friendly Extensibility**
  - API-first architecture.
  - Hooks for custom business logic, integrations, and automation.
